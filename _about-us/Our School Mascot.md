### Our School Mascot

Our mascot, Westie, was unveiled on 14 November 2014 at Showcasing Talents and Recognising Successes (STARS!) 2014. Our mascot depicts an adorable and smart rabbit, similar to our West Springers. The name, Westie, was voted by our WPS staff, school advisory committee members, parents and students. Westie was one of the names shortlisted from a list of names suggested by our parents.

A rabbit is known to be approachable, helpful and offers kind advice. A rabbit is also known to be calm even in the face of chaos, it can hold steady as long as it has a plan.

Rabbits also have a strong inner compass guiding their emotions. When they feel happy, they believe that everything is going well in their life. When they feel sad, they do not wait for it to pass but act upon it in an attempt to right the perceived wrong.

Being naturally inquisitive, a rabbit is always observant of changes and new ideas in the world around it. This inquisitive trait adds excitement in life by allowing it to look beneath the surface and discover new possibilities.
