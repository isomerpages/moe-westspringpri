ON TO A STRONG START!

Dear Parents,

Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for your pre-school child?

We warmly welcome you and your child to visit the MOE Kindergarten Open House!

At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners. We nurture children holistically, so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.

Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey at MOE Kindergarten through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme.

If you require a full-day service for your child, you’ll be pleased to know that Kindergarten Care, which operates from 7am to 7pm from Mondays to Fridays is available at most MOE Kindergartens.

Visit an Open House near you to find out more!

Registrations for admission to K1 in 2019 will be accepted on the day of the Open House and the following Monday.
