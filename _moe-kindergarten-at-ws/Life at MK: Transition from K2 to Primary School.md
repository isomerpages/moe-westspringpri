### LIFE@MK: Transition from K2 to Primary School

The transition from pre-school to primary school is one of the largest and most important changes children have to encounter and manage at a young age. How can we support our children during this process? What makes a successful transition?  
  
In West Spring Primary School, MOE Kindergarten Educators collaborate with Lower Primary teachers to ensure that K2 children will be well-prepared and excited to transit to our primary school in the following year.
