#### CCE Champion

CCE Champions develop leadership skills alongside teaching them to become good citizens within the school community, as well as the wider community. They play an active role in improving the lives of others, and influencing and persuading others to serve the community. It provides the opportunity for students to reach out to the external community through CCE outreach programmes.

Through these programmes, students hone their critical thinking and project management skills as they plan and implement student-led activities. They also have clear set of values and have the ability to inspire others

As a result, an equal emphasis is placedÂ  on helping communities and providing relevant learning experiences to the CCE champions.

#### Green Champion

Green Champions are selected pupils from P5 and P6 who take greater responsibility roles in promoting environmental awareness within and outside school. They assist the teachers in sorting the recyclables into the different types before putting in the different bins. They represent the school in events related to the environment and also in environmental competitions.

#### CCA Champion

As student leaders, CCA Champions are given the opportunity to be role models and mentors to members of their respective CCA groups. CCA teachers select students who demonstrate passion in their CCA, exert a positive influence on their fellow members and are able to rally them towards attaining learning goals for each session. Students who are identified undergo basic training to expand their existing repertoire of peer leadership and communication skills. They then apply their learning by working closely with their CCA teachers to manage and motivate fellow CCA members. As part of their development, they will be tasked with general leadership, planning and organizational duties (e.g. attendance taking, leading warm ups and team meetings) with guidance from their teachers. We hope that through this platform, the CCA Champions will grow into Learners driven by Passion and Leaders guided by Values.
