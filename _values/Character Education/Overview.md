### Character & Citizenship Education (CCE)

The Character and Citizenship Department aims to provide our students with multiple opportunities to develop and acquire values, knowledge and skills through varied classroom lessons and school experiences.

Our CCE Framework is rooted in our school values 3RICH. It seeks to achieve the 21st Century Competencies and Desired Student Outcomes Framework by MOE through four key programmes in the school: Character Development, Values in Action, Citizenship and Student Leadership. The school mission and the school values are at the core of our CCE Framework; it anchors what we seek to achieve in our students.
