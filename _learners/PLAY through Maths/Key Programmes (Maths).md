**Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM)**

Through specialised early intervention programmes, learning support is provided for students who need additional help with Mathematics. Our LSM programme aims to support these young learners in their development of numeracy skills and number sense.

Interactive lessons, in tandem with resources like manipulatives, engage studentsâ€™ various senses in their learning.

Our LSM teachers are highly skilled and dedicated in building a conducive and engaging environment where students feel secure in making mistakes and learning the necessary mathematical know-how while building a positive attitude and keen interest towards the subject.

**Mathematicians @ Play**

Learning Mathematics is not only about memorising formulas and concepts but also applying these concepts to solve novel and real-life challenges.

Mathematicians @ Play provides opportunities for the use of ICT and puzzles to engage students. From the basic operations with numbers to complex challenges in the form of games, students develop an interest in the subject and build perseverance and motivation to best their scores and overcome levels within these games.
