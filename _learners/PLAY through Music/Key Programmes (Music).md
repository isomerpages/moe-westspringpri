#### Stomp Percussion Programme

In this programme, students learn to use everyday household items such as buckets, pans, plates, bowls, chopsticks, and bins to play more complex rhythms. Students learn to play their rhythms in parts steadily. Every class is provided with an opportunity to improvise their own rhythms. Students will be ready to play as an ensemble and put up a stage performance by the end of the programme.
