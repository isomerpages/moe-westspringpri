### PLAY through Music

#### Teaching and Learning Approach

West Spring Primary School music curriculum aims to support the holistic development of our students’ music education through PLAY (**P**urposeful **L**earning **A**ctivities for the **Y**oung) and music appreciation in both local and global context. Learning music helps to enrich students’ social, cultural and historical awareness. Students also develop critical thinking skills and aesthetic sensitivity through music appreciation and various activities learned in music lessons. The diagram below summarises the main objectives of the music curriculum.

#### Infusing PLAY in Music Lessons

Infusing PLAY in music is a key approach in West Spring Primary School’s curriculum. During music lessons, students are encouraged to show their creativity and work collaboratively. They even get a chance to interact with students from overseas. The PLAY approach is student-centric, engaging and fun.
