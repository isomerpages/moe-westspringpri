The aims of an art education are to enable every child to be visually literate and to appreciate art.

In West Spring Primary School, our Art department supports the above mission through the 5‘E’s approach: to provide students with a variety of learning **E**xperiences, **E**ngagement through student-centred pedagogy, **E**xposure through various famous artists’ artworks, **E**nrichment through modular programmes as well as **E**xhibitions as platforms for showcase of talents and efforts.
