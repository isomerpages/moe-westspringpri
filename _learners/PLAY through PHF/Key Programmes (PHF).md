### Key Programmes (PHF)

#### SwimSafer 2.0

SwimSafer 2.0, which is part of the Physical Education (PE) Curriculum, aims to develop students’ basic swimming proficiency skills, water confidence and water safety through several swimming sessions. 

In the swimming sessions, learning takes place progressively from managing personal mobility confidently and safely with and without floating aids to emphasis on using specified swim forms and managing water safety for water-based activities. These sessions are conducted by qualified swimming instructors engaged by the school to make learning safe and fun!

Dispatcher-Assisted first REsponder (DARE) is integrated into the school’s Physical Education (PE) Curriculum. This programme aligns with one of the Physical and Health Fitness (PHF) topics on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and the use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

This hands-on programme equips students with the following knowledge and skills:

1\.  learning to work alongside a 995 specialist,<br>
2.  learning to perform simplified chest compressions and lastly,<br>
3.  using an AED on a cardiac arrest victime.

We hope students can apply the skills to assist in real life situations!
