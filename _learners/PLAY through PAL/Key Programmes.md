### Key Programmes (PAL)

#### Visual Arts

Through participating in these Visual Arts activities, students learn how to apply the relevant social emotional competenciesÂ to better understand themselves, their friends and how to work collaboratively with others.

In this activity, P2 students learn about the different cultures in their community through tile designs. Upon discussion for ideas, students create their own tile design. Each design is unique as it depicts different theme or culture.

#### Outdoor Education

Our PAL Outdoor Education Module encourages our students to be curious as they explore and enjoy the outdoors. Students learn through their senses and explore the relationships between the world and themselves.

Children are often intrigued by sand and playing in the sand gives endless opportunities for fun and learning. In our sand play activities, students enjoy digging into sand, touching or sifting it, drawing on it and building things with sand.
